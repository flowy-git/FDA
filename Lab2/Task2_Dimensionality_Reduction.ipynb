    "# Task 2 - Dimensionality Reduction (27 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Description:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of datasets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one, while preserving as much  variance  as  possible.  There  are  two  methods  for  performing  a  Principal  Component  Analysis:  using Eigenvector  Decomposition  (EIG)  and  the  more  generalized  Singular  Value  Decomposition  (SVD). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** In this exercise, you will use the Wheat Seeds[1] dataset, which involves the prediction of species given measurements of seeds from different types of wheat. The dataset can be found as `seeds.csv` in the data folder. Do not forget to exclude the data that should not be considered for dimensionality reduction when you apply the algorithms on the dataset.\n",
