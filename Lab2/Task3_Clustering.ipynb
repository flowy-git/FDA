    "# Task 3 - Clustering (34 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Description:** A student who has not attended this course yet but who is interested in data mining tried to cluster two datasets. Unfortunately, they did not succeed and asked you for some help. In this task, you will read what the student said about their experience and help them by describing the data and the clustering algorithms. You will also try out the clustering algorithms yourself to make sure that your recommendations are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quality Assessment:** To encourage you not to use AI tools and to write the solutions yourself, we will deduct additional points if your solutions are consequently weird (e.g. describe clusters as \"precise\" or \"irregular\") or do not answer the question. If you write the solutions yourself, paying attention to the task description, this should not affect you (even if you make some mistakes). However, if you copy answers form AI tools, which often use weird words or return irrelevant solutions, you will most likely get negative points, reducing the total points you get for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** The data folder contains the input files (`dataset1.csv`, `dataset2.csv`). In each dataset the data points have 2 features and 1 class label. Do not forget to exclude the data that should not be considered for clustering when you apply the algorithms on the datasets."
